# OrbitalToolKit
A collection of basic orbital mechanics tools to aid in orbit planning

## Welcome to OrbitalToolKit (otk)!
- This project is a collection of different basic tools to aid in the calculation and planning of orbital flights
- A list of current tools in this suite include:
- ... nothing currently, because I haven't coded any tools yet!
- Hopes are to have at least a Hohmann Transfer Calculator by presentation time!
- Who knows what else I will add before or after that time!?
